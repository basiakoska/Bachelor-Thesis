# Bachelor-Thesis
Repository consisting of dashboards and codes made for bachelor thesis

Repository dashboards:
a) 2019_visualisation consists of interactive graphs only for 2019 year with business/leisure devision
b) 2022visualisation consists of interactive graphs only for 2022 year business/leisure devision
a) 2022and2019 consists of interactive graphs comparing years 2019 and 2022

All power BI dashboards are interactive, therefore clicking at any graph, for instance business type, will change data focusing only on business travels. 

Repository codes:
1. 2019_coupon_reservation and 2022_coupon_reservation: merging two datasets for each year into one and data manipulation, extracting Fare code (STU/BAS/PLU/PRE/SEN), Type of travel etc. 
2. 2019and2022: Combining individual 2019 and 2022 datasets, data preparation
3. Feature Selection: ExtraTreesRegressor method for selecting important features for machine learning algorithms
4. ARIMAX: ARIMAX algorithm
5. SARIMAX: SARIMAX algorithm
6. LSTM_timeseries: LSTM algorithm
7. ANN: artificial neural network algorithm together with implemented GUI
8. ANN_2019: artificial neural network algorithm only with the use of 2019 dataset
